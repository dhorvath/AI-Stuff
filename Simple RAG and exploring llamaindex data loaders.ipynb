She expresses a preference for rearranging floral arrangements for aesthetic appeal but quickly shifts to cooking. The tart features a crust similar to a Cheez-It, made from flour, polenta, Parmesan, and butter, and highlights the importance of using water to bind it. After preparing and baking the crust, Roman slices various tomatoes for the filling, recommending their use regardless of quality. The tart is baked with the tomatoes seasoned with garlic, olive oil, and optional capers. After baking, she emphasizes serving it warm or at room temperature. She offers insights on cooking with leftover ingredients for a salad and encourages viewers to enjoy the tart with different side dishes. The episode celebrates the joys of cooking with fresh, seasonal produce."
